## 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: Can I just copy this code for my assignment?**  
A: No. Your professor wants YOU to build something. Use this as a learning example.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Ask Claude/Copilot! Show them the error and ask "Why is this failing and how do I fix it?"

**Q: Do I need to read all the docs?**  
A: No! Start with the 3 above. Only read others if you need deeper info.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: 
- Understanding this repo: 2-3 hours
- Building your own project: 15-20 hours
- Getting to 90% test coverage: Worth it for your grade

## 🔥 Pro Tips

1. **Clone OpenAI docs locally** so Claude can read them:
```bash
mkdir references
cd references
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-python.git
# Now ask Claude to read from references/
```

2. **Start small** - Build one feature at a time with tests

3. **Commit often** - Git save = life save

4. **Ask "why"** - Don't just copy code. Understand it.
