## � About This Assignment

This is a **2-week project-based learning experience** where you'll build a creative application using OpenAI's APIs while learning professional software development practices. This repository serves as your **reference implementation**—a real-world example of how enterprise development teams write production-quality code. You'll learn to collaborate with AI tools (like Claude) not as a crutch, but as a **creative partner** in the development process, using Test-Driven Development (TDD), professional git workflows, enterprise logging, and automated testing.

By the end, you won't just have a working project—you'll have learned the **vocabulary, patterns, and practices** that professional development teams use daily. You'll understand how to leverage AI to accelerate development while maintaining high code quality standards. Most importantly, you'll gain confidence in your ability to build, test, and demonstrate real software that solves real problems.

## 🔍 What This Web Search Tool Does

This repository contains a **production-quality web search application** built using OpenAI's latest APIs. When you run it, the tool takes your search query, sends it to OpenAI's search-enhanced models, and returns intelligent, sourced results with citations—think of it as a smarter web search that understands context and provides AI-generated summaries.

**Example:**
```bash
$ python -m src.main "latest developments in quantum computing"

# Returns: AI-generated summary with citations from recent sources
# Shows: Web sources, structured analysis, and referenced URLs
```

**What makes this "enterprise-quality"?**
- 🧪 **100% test coverage** - Every feature is tested
- 📊 **Enterprise logging** - Production-ready monitoring with log rotation
- 🔄 **CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing on every commit
- 🎯 **Clean architecture** - Separation of concerns (models, client, parser, service)
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful failures with informative messages
- 📝 **Type hints & documentation** - Self-documenting code

We built this tool using the **same techniques you'll use** for your project. In fact, we even used this very tool to research OpenAI's APIs and create the [comprehensive OpenAI Tools Research document](docs/openai_tools_research_oct2025.md) that you'll reference throughout your project. This demonstrates the power of building practical tools with AI—you can use what you create to accelerate your own learning!

**Your turn:** Pick a different OpenAI API or combination of APIs and build something equally impressive.

## � Code as Textbook: Learn by Reading

**This codebase is designed as a living textbook.** Every file is heavily commented with explanations, examples, and design decisions. Instead of just showing you WHAT the code does, the comments explain WHY and teach you the underlying concepts.

### 🎓 Start Here: [Code as Textbook Guide](docs/CODE_AS_TEXTBOOK.md)

This guide provides:
- **📚 Chapter-by-chapter reading order** (each source file is a chapter)
- **🎯 Multiple learning paths** based on your experience level
- **💡 Concept explanations** woven into the code comments
- **🔍 Cross-references** between related concepts
- **📖 Story-based narrative** that makes code feel like a book

**Reading Paths Available:**
1. **"I'm New to Python"** - Learn Python through a real project
2. **"Teach Me Architecture"** - Understand application structure
3. **"Master Testing"** - Deep dive into TDD
4. **"Full Story"** - Read cover-to-cover like a textbook

**Example of what you'll find in the code:**
```python
# From src/models.py:
"""
📖 CHAPTER 1: THE FOUNDATION - DATA MODELS

STORY: Building Blocks of Our Application
------------------------------------------
Imagine you're building a house. Before you start construction, 
you need blueprints. In software, these blueprints are called 
"data models"...

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
✓ Understand Python dataclasses
✓ Learn type hints for better documentation
✓ Master properties (computed attributes)
...
"""
```

Each file teaches you:
- **What** the code does (functionality)
- **Why** it's written this way (design decisions)  
- **How** to use it (examples)
- **Alternatives** we didn't choose (and why)

💡 **This is unique:** Most codebases have minimal comments. We've turned ours into a narrative textbook where each chapter builds on the last, teaching you professional software engineering through storytelling.
