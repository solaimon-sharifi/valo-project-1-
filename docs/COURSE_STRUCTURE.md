## Week 1: Foundation

### Session 1 (90 min): Architecture & Patterns

**Learning Objective:** Understand how production applications are structured

#### Part 1: Setup & Exploration (25 min)

**Do This:**
1. Complete [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) if not done
2. Run the application with different queries
3. Observe the output format
4. Look at the file structure

**Try:**
```bash
python -m src.main "machine learning basics"
python -m src.main "latest SpaceX news" --verbose
python -m src.main "Python tutorials" --model gpt-4o
```

**Observe:**
- How does it format results?
- What happens with `--verbose`?
- How are sources cited?

#### Part 2: Read Code as Narrative (45 min in-class, continue at home)

**Do This:**
1. Open `src/models.py`
2. Read it like a textbook chapter
3. Try the examples in Python REPL
4. Ask yourself: "Why did they do it this way?"

_Note: If you need more time to fully understand the patterns, that's normal! Continue exploration at home._

**Example Interactive Reading:**
```bash
# Open Python REPL
python

# Try the examples from comments
>>> from src.models import SearchOptions
>>> options = SearchOptions()
>>> print(options)
>>> options = SearchOptions(model="gpt-4o", reasoning_effort="high")
>>> print(options)
```

5. Continue with `src/client.py`
6. Notice the design patterns explained in comments

#### Part 3: Hands-On Experimentation (20 min)

**Do This:**
1. Make a small change to `SearchOptions`
2. Run tests to see what breaks
3. Fix it and see tests pass

**Exercise:**
```python
# In src/models.py, add a new field
@dataclass
class SearchOptions:
    model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"
    # Add this:
    max_results: int = 10
```

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/test_models.py -v

# What happened? Why?
```

#### Homework (2-3 hours)

**Reading:**
- [ ] Complete `src/parser.py` (30 min)
- [ ] Complete `src/search_service.py` (30 min)
- [ ] Skim `src/main.py` (20 min)

**Planning:**
- [ ] Read [Project Ideas](PROJECT_IDEAS.md) (20 min)
- [ ] Choose your project idea
- [ ] Read [OpenAI API docs](openai_tools_research_oct2025.md) for your chosen APIs (30 min)
- [ ] Sketch your application architecture on paper

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What problem will your app solve?
2. Which OpenAI APIs will you use?
3. What are 3-5 core features?
4. Who is the user?

---

### Session 2 (90 min): Test-Driven Development

**Learning Objective:** Master TDD methodology and understand how tests prove correctness

#### Part 1: Understand Test Patterns (30 min)

**Do This:**
1. Read [TDD Workflow Guide](TDD_WORKFLOW.md)
2. Open `tests/conftest.py`
3. See how fixtures provide reusable test data
4. Open `tests/test_models.py`
5. Notice the pattern: Arrange → Act → Assert

**Example Test Anatomy:**
```python
def test_create_default_search_options():
    """Test that default options are created correctly."""
    # ARRANGE: Setup (often empty for simple tests)
    
    # ACT: Create the object
    options = SearchOptions()
    
    # ASSERT: Verify expectations
    assert options.model == "gpt-4o-mini"
    assert options.allowed_domains is None
```

6. Continue with `tests/test_client.py`
7. See how we mock external API calls

#### Part 2: Practice TDD (40 min)

**Do This - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:**

**RED - Write Failing Test:**
```bash
# Create new test file
touch tests/test_my_feature.py
```

```python
# tests/test_my_feature.py
def test_feature_that_doesnt_exist_yet():
    """Test that my new feature works."""
    # This will fail because feature doesn't exist
    from src.models import MyNewFeature
    feature = MyNewFeature(value=42)
    assert feature.doubled() == 84
```

```bash
# Run it - should fail
pytest tests/test_my_feature.py -v
# ✅ Good! Failing test = RED phase
```

**GREEN - Make It Pass:**
```python
# src/models.py
@dataclass
class MyNewFeature:
    value: int
    
    def doubled(self) -> int:
        return self.value * 2
```

```bash
# Run again - should pass
pytest tests/test_my_feature.py -v
# ✅ Good! Passing test = GREEN phase
```

**REFACTOR - Improve Code:**
```python
# Make it more Pythonic
@dataclass
class MyNewFeature:
    value: int
    
    @property
    def doubled(self) -> int:
        """Return double the value."""
        return self.value * 2
```

```bash
# Tests still pass after refactoring
pytest tests/test_my_feature.py -v
# ✅ Good! Tests protect your refactoring
```

#### Part 3: Group Discussion (20 min)

**Discuss:**
1. Why write tests before code?
2. What did you find surprising?
3. How would you test your project idea?

**Share:**
- Your project idea
- One concern about testing it
- Get feedback from peers

#### Homework (3-4 hours)

**Practice:**
- [ ] Read remaining test files (1 hour)
- [ ] Write 3 test cases for your project (pseudocode is fine) (1 hour)

**Planning:**
- [ ] Read [AI Collaboration Guide](AI_COLLABORATION.md) (15 min)
- [ ] Read [Git Workflow Guide](GIT_WORKFLOW.md) (15 min)
- [ ] Create GitHub repo for your project (15 min)
- [ ] Write initial README for your project (30 min)
- [ ] Draft your data models on paper (30 min)

git commit -m "chore: Initial project structure"
```

#### Part 2: Build Core Models with TDD (45 min)

**RED Phase - Write Tests First:**
```python
# tests/test_models.py
"""Tests for data models."""
import pytest
from src.models import MyMainModel

def test_create_my_model():
    """Test creating the main model."""
    model = MyMainModel(name="test", value=42)
    assert model.name == "test"
    assert model.value == 42

def test_model_validation():
    """Test that model validates input."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        MyMainModel(name="", value=-1)
```

```bash
# Should fail - feature doesn't exist
pytest tests/test_models.py -v
```

**GREEN Phase - Implement:**
```python
# src/models.py
"""Data models for my AI application."""
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class MyMainModel:

## Tips for Success

### Time Management
- **Don't build too much** - 5-7 features is plenty
- **Start simple** - You can always add more
- **Leave time for testing** - Tests take longer than you think
- **Polish matters** - Better to have 3 great features than 10 broken ones

### Technical Strategy
- **Copy patterns** - Use reference code as template
- **Test first** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR always
- **Commit often** - Small, atomic commits
- **Ask for help early** - Don't struggle for hours alone

### Demo Preparation
- **Practice timing** - 5 minutes goes fast
- **Have backup plan** - Screenshots if live demo fails
- **Focus on one thing** - Don't try to show everything
- **Tell a story** - Problem → Solution → How you built it

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **"I'll add tests later"** → You won't. Tests first!  
❌ **"I'll build everything"** → Scope creep kills projects  
❌ **"I'll figure out git later"** → Commit from day one  
❌ **"I don't need to practice demo"** → Yes you do!  
❌ **"It works on my machine"** → Test on fresh clone
