# Spectator Ghost Personas

The Spectator Ghost can be configured with different coaching personas. Example personas included in the demo UI:

- Aggressive — prioritizes entry strategies and fast trades
- Defensive — focuses on rotations, crossfire setups, and utility use
- Tactical — explains decision-making, economy, and teamplay

Each persona adjusts the tone and the tactical focus of the AI responses; you can extend them by changing prompt templates in the frontend or backend.
