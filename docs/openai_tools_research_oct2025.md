## � How This Document Was Created

This comprehensive research document was generated using **the very web search tool in this repository**! We ran multiple searches through `python -m src.main` with queries like:
- "OpenAI API tools and capabilities October 2025"
- "OpenAI Chat Completion API GPT-4 features"
- "OpenAI DALL-E 3 image generation API"
- "OpenAI Whisper speech-to-text API"
- And many more...

Each search returned AI-generated summaries with citations from authoritative sources, which we compiled into this structured reference guide. **This demonstrates the power of building practical AI tools**—you can use what you create to accelerate your own work! This document will help you understand what's possible with OpenAI's APIs so you can choose the right tool for your 2-week project.

### Best Practices

```python
# Example: Moderation API usage
import openai

def moderate_content(text):
    response = openai.Moderation.create(
        input=text
    )
    
    result = response["results"][0]
    
    # Check if content is flagged
    if result["flagged"]:
        print("⚠️ Content flagged!")
        print("\nCategory scores:")
        for category, score in result["category_scores"].items():
            if result["categories"][category]:
                print(f"  {category}: {score:.4f} ✗ FLAGGED")
            else:
                print(f"  {category}: {score:.4f}")
        return False
    else:
        print("✓ Content passed moderation")
        return True

# Example usage
text = "This is a normal, friendly message."
is_safe = moderate_content(text)

if is_safe:
    # Process the content
    pass
else:
    # Handle flagged content
    pass
```

### Integration Strategies

#### 1. **Input Filtering**
```python
# Before processing user input
user_input = get_user_input()
if not moderate_content(user_input):
    return "Content violates our policies"
process_input(user_input)
```

#### 2. **Output Filtering**
```python
# Before showing AI response
ai_response = generate_response(query)
if not moderate_content(ai_response):
    return "I cannot provide that response"
return ai_response
```

#### 3. **Batch Processing**
```python
# Moderate multiple items
comments = fetch_pending_comments()
for comment in comments:
    if moderate_content(comment.text):
        approve_comment(comment)
    else:
        flag_for_review(comment)
```
