# Project Overview

Valo Spectator Ghost is a compact demo that showcases an AI-powered tactical assistant for Valorant-style play. It demonstrates:

- Using the OpenAI API to produce tactical advice and commentary
- A small Flask frontend for interactive demos (`/spectator-ghost`)
- Test-driven development with a full pytest suite
- Clean, modular Python code in `src/`

Purpose: provide a concise, demonstrable project suitable for classroom submission or a live demo.
